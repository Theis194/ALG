Write a pseudocode of an algorithm to reverse an array of numbers, i.e., the last element should
become the first, the second last should become the second, etc. 

For example, the reverse of [1, 2, 3, 4] is [4, 3, 2, 1].

(a) What is the worst-case running time of your algorithm?


(b) Try now to propose an algorithm that use only a constant amount of extra space. What is the
worst-case running time of your algorithm?3)
