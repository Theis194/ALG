Exercise 2.
Consider the following pseudocode for the function Find-Element takes as input an array A[1 . . n] and 
a number a.

Find-Element(A, a)

for i = 1 to A.length 
    if A[i] = a
        return i 
return i

(a) Count the number of iterations of the for loop in the above pseudocode for the execution of 
Find-Element([1, 0, 5, 2, 4], 5) and report the value returned at the end of the call.
-   The for-loop returns the value i = 3 -> So the number of iterations is also 3

(b) Is the above algorithm solving the element search problem presented in class? 
Justify your answer.

We check termination if the number is not in the list:
If a is not occuring in the sequence of elements in A.lenght it will 
return the lenght of the A.length + 1 and therefore returns an incorrect 
number that might not be in the list.
Hence it does not solve the problem addressed in the class.
